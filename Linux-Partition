Disk partitioning is one step of disk formatting. 
It is the process of dividing a disk into one or more regions, the so called partitions.
If a partition is created, the disk will store the information about thelocation and 
size of partitions in partition table that is usually located in the first sector of a disk.

 /etc/mtab is a file which stores the information of all the currently mounted file 
systems; it is dynamic and keeps changing. 

/etc/fstab is the file which is keeps information about the permanent mount point. If 
you want to make your mount point permanent, so that it will be mounted even after 
reboot, then you need to make an appropriate entry in this file.
